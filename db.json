The flowers consist of six petal-like segments, which may form the shape of a trumpet, with a more or less elongated tube, as in the Madonna lily (Lilium candidum) and Easter lily (L. longiflorum). Alternatively, the segments may be reflexed (curved back) to form a turban shape, as in the Turk's cap lily (L. martagon), or they may be less strongly reflexed and form an open cup or bowl shape, as in the wood lily (L. philadelphicum) and goldband lily (L. auratum). The flowers of some species are quite fragrant, and they occur in a wide variety of colours. Plants of most species range in height from 30 to 120 cm (1 to 4 feet); plants of certain species, however, exceed 2.5 metres (8 feet) in height.",

Those attached to other plants often are vinelike and have a spongy root covering called the velamen that absorbs water from the surrounding air. Most species manufacture their own food, but some live on dead organic material (saprophytic) or are helped to obtain nourishment by a fungus living in their roots.",
